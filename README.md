# COMP345_risk OUT OF DATE
Implementing Risk the board game
</br>
<i>For now, I've just separated Combat and Country/Player because I had different main methods for testing of both</i>
</br>
<strong>Combat</strong>
</br>
<ul>
<li>Simple rolling of dice dependent on number of armies both attacking and defending.</li>
<li>Analysis of rolls and resulting losses.</li>
<li>Number of remaining armies after a battle.</li>
</ul>
Things still being worked on:
<ul>
<li>Displaying attacking and defending countries (no adjacency logic yet)</li>
<li>Ability to continue a battle manually or automatically</li>
</ul>
</br>
<strong>Country/Player</strong>
</br>
Has the basic functionality for countries and players. Including adding/removing countries to/from players, as well as error handling for such operations.
</br>
</br>
Things still being worked on:
<ul>
<li>Setting/Incrementing/Deleting Armies.</li>
<li>Merge Combat with Country/Player and make the logical connections between the two.</li>
</ul>
</br>
<i>Things to come: Cards and Continents</i>
